# From Novice to Power Apps Pro: My Year at Cambium-Inc

When I first started my Technology Adoption Support internship at Cambium-Inc in September 2022, I had zero experience with Microsoft's Power Platform. Fast forward one year, and I had designed and implemented multiple custom applications that transformed how the company managed internal processes.

## The Initial Challenge

Cambium-Inc, a multi-service consulting and engineering company, had recently adopted Microsoft 365 but wasn't utilizing its full potential. My job was to help employees adopt new technologies and create solutions that would enhance their daily work.

The problem? I had never used Power Apps, Power Automate, or SharePoint before.

## The Learning Curve

My first few weeks were spent learning everything I could about SharePoint. I proactively purchased a course on Udemy (which the company reimbursed) and completed it in under two weeks. This foundation allowed me to start creating solutions almost immediately.

The most significant project I tackled was developing a SharePoint site called "Cambium Academy" - a centralized knowledge base for the company's training videos and standard procedure documents.

## Building My First Applications

After gaining confidence with SharePoint, I moved on to Power Apps and Power Automate. My first real project involved creating a simple workflow for users to enter project names into a SharePoint list. The flow would then automatically generate folders and subfolders following a standardized structure.

This initial success led to more ambitious projects:

### The Vacation Request System

This was my most comprehensive application, integrating:
- Power Apps for the form frontend
- Power Automate for workflow automation
- SharePoint for database storage
- Microsoft Teams and Outlook for notifications

The system allowed employees to:
1. Submit vacation requests through a user-friendly interface
2. Automatically route requests to appropriate managers
3. Track approval status in real-time
4. Maintain a centralized record of all time-off requests

The response from users was overwhelmingly positive. Managers especially appreciated the streamlined approval process, which had previously been handled through a cumbersome email system.

### Field Data Collection App

Later in my term, I tackled a more complex challenge: developing an application that would enable field workers to collect data about their tasks, store it automatically, and generate reports based on standard templates.

This project allowed me to expand my skills to include:
- Database development using Dataverse
- Complex application logic with Power Fx
- Advanced workflow automation in Power Automate

## Key Lessons Learned

My experience at Cambium-Inc taught me several important lessons:

1. **Proactive learning pays off**: Taking the initiative to learn technologies before I needed them allowed me to deliver solutions faster.

2. **Start small, then scale**: Beginning with simple automations built confidence and created quick wins before tackling larger projects.

3. **User feedback is invaluable**: Regular check-ins with end-users helped refine applications to better meet their needs.

4. **Documentation is crucial**: Creating clear tutorials and documentation ensured that solutions remained useful long after I completed them.

5. **You don't need to know everything**: One of my most commonly used phrases was, "I don't know, but I can find out." The willingness to learn on the job is perhaps the most valuable skill in technology.

## The Impact

By the end of my internship, I had created multiple applications that significantly improved efficiency and collaboration at Cambium-Inc. The Vacation Request system alone saved approximately 5 hours per week in administrative time.

More importantly, I helped establish a culture of technology adoption that extended beyond my specific projects. Employees began to see the potential of these tools and started exploring them on their own.

## Looking Forward

My experience at Cambium-Inc fundamentally shaped my approach to problem-solving and technology implementation. I learned that technical skills, while important, are secondary to understanding user needs and designing solutions that genuinely improve workflows.

As I move forward in my career, I'll carry these lessons with me: start with a solid foundation, build incrementally, listen to users, and never stop learning.

# Navigating Framework Migration: From Yii to Laravel at eCenter Research

During my software development internship at eCenter Research from May to August 2024, I undertook one of the most challenging yet rewarding projects of my career so far: migrating an entire web application from the Yii framework to Laravel. This blog post details the journey, challenges, and valuable lessons learned along the way.

## The Migration Challenge

eCenter Research specializes in providing comprehensive platforms for drug and mental health courts, corrections departments, and behavioral health service providers. My primary task was collaborating with another co-op student to translate an existing product built with the Yii PHP framework to Laravel, a more modern PHP framework with enhanced features and better support.

The stakes were high: we needed to ensure all functionality was preserved while taking advantage of Laravel's improvements in security, performance, and developer experience.

## Mastering the MVC Architecture

While I had studied the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern in my coursework, applying it to a real-world application revealed its true complexity and elegance. Laravel and Yii both follow this pattern, but with important implementation differences.

Working on this migration allowed me to deeply understand how MVC creates maintainable code by separating:
- Models (data and business logic)
- Views (user interface elements)
- Controllers (handling requests and responses)

This separation proved essential when translating components between frameworks while ensuring they remained functionally equivalent.

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Models and Controllers Reimplementation

A significant portion of my work involved reimplementing models and controllers in Laravel. This required:

1. Learning Laravel's Eloquent ORM system to replace Yii's ActiveRecord implementation
2. Translating complex SQL queries to Eloquent query builder syntax
3. Understanding Laravel's conventions for naming, relationships, and data handling

One particularly challenging aspect was translating complex joins and subqueries from raw SQL to Eloquent. Initially, my limited SQL experience made this difficult, but as I progressed, I developed a systematic approach to breaking down and reconstructing these queries.

### Database Migrations

Database structure translation required creating migration files to generate tables that aligned with Laravel's expectations while preserving the data relationships. This process taught me:

- How to create efficient database schemas
- The importance of properly defining foreign key constraints
- Techniques for data transformation during migration

The most complex migration involved a table with polymorphic relationships - a concept I had never encountered before. After researching Laravel's documentation and working through examples, I successfully implemented the solution, giving me confidence in tackling advanced database concepts.

### Debugging Skills Development

My debugging abilities grew exponentially during this project. I learned to:

- Use browser developer tools to trace network requests and responses
- Add log statements to view SQL queries and variable values in real-time
- Create systematic approaches to isolating and resolving errors

The most valuable debugging technique I discovered was to trace the execution path by placing strategic log statements throughout the code, allowing me to pinpoint exactly where unexpected behavior originated.

## Collaboration Tools and Techniques

Working closely with another co-op student required establishing effective collaboration protocols. We:

1. Maintained a shared Google document to track our progress on translating models, controllers, and other components
2. Used Git and GitHub for version control, allowing us to merge our work efficiently
3. Held daily meetings with our supervisor to discuss challenges and coordinate efforts

This collaborative approach prevented duplicate work and ensured consistent implementation patterns across the application.

## Learning Laravel Nova

In the final month of my internship, I was introduced to Laravel Nova, a management interface for Laravel applications. This added another layer to our migration project, requiring us to:

- Create resources that mapped to our models
- Define fields, relationships, and actions for the administrative interface
- Customize the interface to match the client's needs

Working with Nova expanded my understanding of Laravel's ecosystem and introduced me to concepts like resource authorization, custom fields, and action workflows.

## Key Takeaways

This migration project taught me several valuable lessons:

1. **Framework understanding**: Learning how and why frameworks make specific design choices helps in translating between them effectively.

2. **Progressive skill building**: Starting with simpler components before tackling complex ones allowed me to build confidence and skills incrementally.

3. **Documentation importance**: Both reading and writing clear documentation proved essential for maintaining consistency across a large project.

4. **Team communication**: Regular check-ins and clear documentation of progress prevented redundant work and ensured alignment.

5. **Adaptability**: Frameworks evolve, and the ability to adapt to new paradigms is more valuable than expertise in any specific technology.

## Looking Forward

The skills I gained during this migration project have proven invaluable. Beyond the technical knowledge of Laravel and database design, I developed a systematic approach to problem-solving that applies across all development projects.

As I continue my software development journey, I'm excited to apply these lessons to future framework migrations and other complex technical challenges. Most importantly, I've learned that with the right approach, even the most daunting technical migrations can be broken down into manageable components and successfully completed.

# The Art and Science of Prompt Engineering: My Experience at Outlier

Since February 2024, I've been working as a Prompt Engineer at Outlier, focusing on the mathematics domain. This experience has opened my eyes to an emerging field that sits at the fascinating intersection of human communication, artificial intelligence, and subject matter expertise.

## What is Prompt Engineering?

While many people interact with AI models by simply typing questions, prompt engineering goes much deeper. It involves crafting carefully designed inputs that guide AI models to produce accurate, helpful, and appropriate outputs. As AI systems become more integrated into our daily lives, the ability to communicate effectively with these systems becomes increasingly valuable.

My role specifically focuses on mathematics - generating complex mathematical questions, evaluating AI responses for accuracy, and helping improve how AI models understand and solve math problems.

## The Challenges of Mathematical Prompts

Mathematics presents unique challenges for AI systems. Unlike more subjective domains, math has objectively correct and incorrect answers. A slight error in calculation or reasoning can invalidate an entire solution. Additionally, mathematical notation, symbols, and formal reasoning create complexities that AI models must navigate.

Some of the specific challenges I've encountered include:

### 1. Notation and Formatting

Mathematical expressions require precise notation. When creating prompts, I need to ensure that expressions are formatted in a way that the AI can interpret correctly. This often means finding the right balance between formal mathematical notation and plain text representations that the model can process.

### 2. Reasoning Chains

Mathematics relies heavily on step-by-step reasoning. A good mathematical solution doesn't just provide the answer but explains the logical progression from the given information to the conclusion. My prompts need to encourage the AI to show its work and reasoning, not just the final result.

### 3. Common Misconceptions

Like human students, AI models can develop "misconceptions" about mathematical concepts based on their training data. Part of my work involves identifying these misconceptions and designing prompts that help the model correct its understanding.

## Techniques I've Developed

Through my work at Outlier, I've refined several techniques for effective mathematical prompt engineering:

### Graduated Complexity

I've found that starting with simpler versions of problems before introducing more complex elements helps the AI build up its "understanding" incrementally. For example, before asking about a complex calculus problem, I might first prompt about the relevant differentiation rules in isolation.

### Explicit Reasoning Requests

Prompts that explicitly ask the AI to "think step by step" or "explain your reasoning for each step" typically yield more accurate results than simply asking for the answer. This approach seems to activate more thorough processing within the model.

### Counter-example Training

When I identify a pattern of errors, I design prompts that specifically address those misconceptions. By providing counter-examples and explicit corrections, I can help refine the model's responses.

### Contextual Scaffolding

Providing relevant context or "reminders" of key principles before asking the main question often improves performance. For example, briefly mentioning the relevant theorem before asking a proof question can lead to more accurate responses.

## Evaluating AI Responses

Perhaps the most critical aspect of my role is evaluating the AI's mathematical responses. This involves:

1. Checking mathematical accuracy (Are calculations correct? Is the reasoning valid?)
2. Assessing clarity and comprehensibility (Would a student understand this explanation?)
3. Identifying subtle errors or incomplete reasoning
4. Comparing multiple solution approaches for the same problem

This evaluation process requires both mathematical expertise and an understanding of how AI models process and generate text. The goal is to help the AI system become a more effective mathematics tutor over time.

## Impact on My Technical Development

Working as a prompt engineer has significantly enhanced my technical skills in unexpected ways:

### 1. Deeper Mathematical Understanding

To effectively prompt and evaluate AI responses, I've had to deepen my own mathematical knowledge. There's truth to the saying that you only truly understand something when you can teach it to others - including AI systems!

### 2. Insight into Machine Learning Systems

Although my role doesn't involve direct ML programming, working closely with AI models has given me practical insights into how these systems process information, their capabilities, and their limitations.

### 3. Technical Communication Skills

Prompt engineering is fundamentally about communication - translating human intentions into language that AI systems can effectively process. This has improved my ability to communicate technical concepts clearly and precisely.

### 4. Systematic Testing and Evaluation

The methodical approach required for testing AI responses has strengthened my skills in systematic evaluation and quality assurance - valuable skills applicable across many technical domains.

## Looking to the Future

As AI systems continue to advance, prompt engineering will likely evolve into an even more sophisticated discipline. I anticipate several developments:

1. More specialized prompt engineering roles focused on particular domains (medicine, law, education, etc.)
2. The development of formal methodologies and best practices for prompt design
3. Tools specifically designed to assist with prompt creation and evaluation
4. Increased integration between prompt engineering and traditional software development

My experience at Outlier has positioned me at the forefront of this emerging field, and I'm excited to continue developing these skills as AI technology advances.

## Conclusion

Prompt engineering represents a unique blend of technical knowledge, communication skills, and domain expertise. My work in the mathematics domain at Outlier has challenged me to think deeply about how we communicate complex ideas - not just to other humans, but to the increasingly sophisticated AI systems that are becoming part of our technological landscape.

For students and professionals interested in the intersection of AI and their field of expertise, prompt engineering offers an exciting opportunity to contribute to how these technologies will be shaped and applied in the future.

# Building the National Forest Inventory Data Collection App: Lessons in UWP Development

As part of my COIS 4000 Software Engineering Project course at Trent University, I had the opportunity to work on developing a tablet-based field data collection application for forestry professionals. This project, the National Forest Inventory Data Collection App, was an excellent opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to a real-world problem while learning new technologies and development patterns.

## The Project Challenge

Forestry data collection is traditionally done with paper forms in the field, which later need to be manually entered into computer systems. This process is time-consuming and prone to errors. Our challenge was to create a user-friendly, efficient application that would:

1. Allow forestry professionals to collect data in the field using tablets
2. Work in areas with limited or no connectivity
3. Support complex data validation rules
4. Provide an intuitive interface suitable for outdoor field use
5. Securely store and sync data when connectivity was restored

## Technology Stack Selection

After evaluating different options, we selected the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) as our development framework. This decision was based on several factors:

- UWP applications can run on Windows tablets, which are robust enough for field conditions
- The framework provides excellent support for offline functionality
- UWP offers touch-optimized UI components suitable for tablet use
- The XAML-based UI system allows for flexible and responsive designs

For our architecture, we implemented the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern, which proved to be invaluable for maintaining clean separation of concerns throughout the development process.

## Key Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Dynamic UI Layouts

One of the primary challenges was creating layouts that would adapt to different device orientations and screen sizes while maintaining usability in field conditions. Field workers needed large touch targets and clear visual hierarchy.

We solved this by:
- Implementing responsive XAML layouts using Grid and RelativePanel
- Creating adaptive visual states that would trigger based on screen width
- Using the VisualStateManager to handle orientation changes
- Designing UI elements with larger-than-standard touch targets for field use with gloves

### Data Binding and Real-time Updates

The application required complex data entry forms with interdependent fields. For example, selecting certain tree species would change the available options in subsequent fields.

Our solution utilized:
- ObservableCollection for dynamic, reactive lists
- Two-way data binding to automatically update the model when UI values changed
- INotifyPropertyChanged implementation in our ViewModels to propagate changes
- Command pattern for user interactions that would trigger complex updates

### Offline Data Storage and Synchronization

Perhaps the most critical technical challenge was managing data without consistent network connectivity. We implemented:

- A local SQLite database to store collected data
- A queuing system for sync operations
- Background sync processes that would activate when connectivity was detected
- Conflict resolution strategies for handling data edited in multiple locations

### Optimizing T-SQL Queries

As the application grew more complex, we needed to optimize our database interactions. I focused on:
- Designing and optimizing T-SQL queries and stored procedures for data retrieval
- Creating efficient filtering mechanisms for large datasets
- Implementing pagination to handle large result sets on limited device memory
- Using appropriate indexing strategies to speed up common queries

## Testing and Quality Assurance

Throughout development, we implemented a robust testing strategy:
- Unit tests for ViewModels and business logic
- UI automation tests for critical workflows
- Field testing with actual forestry professionals
- Performance testing on target hardware

The most valuable feedback came from field tests, where we discovered usability issues that weren't apparent in laboratory testing. For example, we learned that dropdown menus needed to be larger than we originally designed because forestry workers often wore gloves that made precise touch interactions difficult.

## Debugging Challenges

Working with UWP and the MVVM pattern introduced some unique debugging challenges:
- Binding errors were sometimes difficult to track down
- Type mismatches in data binding would fail silently
- UI inconsistencies could be caused by issues in the ViewModel, View, or binding code

I found that implementing thorough logging throughout the application was invaluable for identifying the source of issues. Additionally, using visual debugging tools like Live Visual Tree in Visual Studio helped isolate UI-related problems.

## Lessons Learned

This project taught me several valuable lessons that I'll carry forward in my development career:

1. **User-centered design is paramount**: No matter how elegant the code, if users find the application difficult to use in their environment, it won't succeed. Field testing with actual users was essential.

2. **Architecture decisions have long-lasting impacts**: The choice of MVVM pattern made code maintenance and feature additions much more manageable throughout the project.

3. **Plan for connectivity issues from the start**: Retrofitting offline capabilities is much more difficult than designing for them from the beginning.

4. **Automated testing saves time**: While setting up automated tests required upfront investment, they caught numerous regression issues as we made changes.

5. **Performance optimization is context-specific**: What works well in an office environment may not be suitable for field use on battery-powered devices.

## Real-World Impact

The National Forest Inventory Data Collection App has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of forestry data collection. By eliminating paper forms and manual data entry, it reduces errors and speeds up the availability of critical environmental data.

While this was an academic project, the principles and techniques we applied are directly relevant to real-world application development, especially for field-use applications in various industries.

## Next Steps

If I were to continue development on this project, I would focus on:
- Expanding the sync capabilities to support bidirectional updates
- Implementing more advanced offline mapping features
- Adding support for capturing and annotating field photos
- Creating a companion web application for data analysis and reporting

## Conclusion

The National Forest Inventory Data Collection App project was a comprehensive learning experience that combined software engineering principles, UWP development, database design, and user experience considerations. Working through the challenges of creating a field-ready application gave me valuable insights into the complete software development lifecycle and practical experience with the MVVM pattern in a real-world context.

# Tracking Election Misinformation: A Big Data Approach

As part of my COIS 4450 Big Data course at Trent University, I'm currently involved in an exciting and timely project that combines data science, machine learning, and social media analysis to tackle a pressing issue: election misinformation. This blog post outlines our approach, the technologies we're using, and the potential impact of this ongoing research.

## The Problem of Election Misinformation

Misinformation during elections has become a significant concern for democratic societies worldwide. Social media platforms can amplify false claims, allowing them to reach millions of people within hours. Understanding how this misinformation spreads, who is most affected by it, and how it might be countered requires analyzing vast amounts of data from multiple sources.

This is fundamentally a big data problem, requiring:
- Real-time data collection from diverse sources
- Processing of unstructured text data at scale
- Advanced analytics to identify patterns and trends
- Visualization tools to communicate findings effectively

## Our Methodology

Our project takes a comprehensive approach to tracking election misinformation on Reddit, one of the world's largest social media platforms. We've designed a multi-stage pipeline that handles everything from data collection to visualization and analysis.

### Data Collection

We're collecting real-time data from Reddit using Python's PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) library. The data collection process focuses on:

- Posts and comments from political subreddits
- Engagement metrics (upvotes, comments, awards)
- User interaction patterns
- Post metadata (timestamps, edits, deletions)

To handle the volume of data, we're using Apache Kafka as a streaming platform, allowing us to process incoming data in real-time while maintaining a persistent record for batch processing.

### Data Processing and Storage

The raw data from Reddit is processed and stored using:

- Apache Spark for distributed data processing
- Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for storage
- MongoDB for storing processed and enriched data

One of the key challenges has been designing a schema that efficiently captures the hierarchical nature of Reddit conversations while still enabling performant queries across millions of records.

### Natural Language Processing and Classification

At the heart of our project is a set of NLP techniques that help us identify potential misinformation:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Measuring the emotional tone of posts and comments
2. **Entity Recognition**: Identifying mentions of people, organizations, and events
3. **Claim Extraction**: Isolating factual claims from opinions and rhetoric
4. **Fact-Checking Integration**: Cross-referencing claims with databases from PolitiFact and Snopes

We're implementing these techniques using Python's spaCy and NLTK libraries, with custom extensions for political content analysis.

### Misinformation Spread Metrics

To understand how misinformation propagates, we're tracking several custom metrics:

- **Virality Index**: A composite score based on spread velocity, reach, and engagement
- **Controversy Ratio**: Measuring disagreement in comments on potentially false claims
- **Cross-Community Spread**: Tracking how content moves between different subreddits
- **Correction Visibility**: Assessing whether fact-checks reach the same audience as the original misinformation

### Visualization and Reporting

Our findings are being visualized through interactive Power BI dashboards that provide:

- Real-time tracking of trending misinformation narratives
- Geographic distribution of engagement with false claims
- Temporal patterns showing how misinformation evolves over time
- Network graphs depicting the spread of specific narratives across communities

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Scaling for Real-Time Processing

Processing Reddit data in real-time presented significant throughput challenges. Our solution leverages Spark Streaming with mini-batch processing, finding the optimal balance between latency and processing efficiency.

The key was tuning our batch intervals carefully – too short and the system overhead became excessive, too long and we lost the "real-time" nature of our analysis.

### Accuracy in Classification

Distinguishing misinformation from opinion or satire is inherently difficult. We're approaching this through a multi-model consensus system:

1. An ensemble of classifiers each specializing in different types of misinformation
2. Confidence scoring that flags borderline cases for human review
3. Continuous model retraining based on new verified examples

### Privacy and Ethical Considerations

Working with social media data requires careful attention to privacy and ethical research practices. Our approach includes:

- Rigorous anonymization of all user data
- Focus on aggregate trends rather than individual behavior
- Compliance with Reddit's Terms of Service for researchers
- Regular ethical reviews of our methodology and findings

## Preliminary Findings

While our research is ongoing, we've already observed several interesting patterns:

1. Misinformation tends to spread in distinct "waves," often triggered by external events
2. Certain types of false claims show different propagation patterns than others
3. Communities vary significantly in their resilience to misinformation
4. Correction attempts often fail to reach the same audience as the original misinformation

These early findings are helping us refine our models and focus our analysis on the most promising avenues for understanding and potentially countering election misinformation.

## Future Directions

As we continue this project, we're planning to expand in several directions:

### Machine Learning Enhancements

We're developing more sophisticated ML models to:
- Predict the potential virality of new misinformation
- Identify accounts that consistently amplify false claims
- Recognize coordination patterns that might indicate organized misinformation campaigns

### Cross-Platform Analysis

While currently focused on Reddit, we hope to extend our analysis to include:
- Twitter/X data for cross-platform comparison
- Traditional news media coverage
- Fact-checking website responses

This would provide a more comprehensive view of how misinformation moves through the broader information ecosystem.

### Mitigation Strategy Testing

Ultimately, we hope our research can inform effective approaches to mitigating election misinformation. We're designing experiments to test:
- The effectiveness of different fact-checking formats
- Optimal timing for correction interventions
- Impact of media literacy prompts on user engagement with suspicious content

## Skills Development and Learning Outcomes

Working on this project has already significantly enhanced my technical skills in:

1. **Big Data Technologies**: Hands-on experience with the Hadoop ecosystem, Spark, and distributed computing
2. **Natural Language Processing**: Practical application of NLP techniques to complex real-world text
3. **Data Visualization**: Creating effective visualizations that communicate complex patterns
4. **Machine Learning**: Implementing and tuning ML models for text classification tasks
5. **Research Methodology**: Designing robust approaches to messy real-world data problems

## Conclusion

The Election Misinformation Tracking project represents an exciting application of big data technologies to a pressing social problem. By combining data science, machine learning, and social network analysis, we're working to better understand how false information spreads during elections and how it might be more effectively countered.

As we continue to refine our methods and expand our dataset, I look forward to sharing more detailed findings about patterns of misinformation spread and potential mitigation strategies. This project highlights how technology can be leveraged not just to understand problems but potentially to help solve them.

*Note: This project is ongoing, and findings mentioned are preliminary. The final analysis and conclusions will be available after the project's completion.*
